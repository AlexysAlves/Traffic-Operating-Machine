# Traffic-Operating-Machine

This repository contains files developed during a scientific initiation project in high school.

Most of the files are different versions of a traffic simulation that was upgraded from its original version available 
at https://github.com/mihir-m-gandhi/Basic-Traffic-Intersection-Simulation. 

This simulation was modified by myself in an attempt to simulate real traffic phenomena, such as phantom jams. 

In addition to the simulation versions that were created 
to meet the different demands of this project, the images used in the simulation are also in the repository, 
as well as auxiliary files used to run simulations in parallel and collect data. 

Finally, there is a file 
that consists of a simple genetic algorithm that uses the simulation to obtain optimal
traffic light times at the studied intersection.
