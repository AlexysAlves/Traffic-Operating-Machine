This repository contains files developed during a scientific initiation project in high school.
Most of the files are different versions of a traffic simulation that was created, using python and pygame, 
in an attempt to recreate real traffic phenomena. In addition to the simulation versions that were created 
to meet the different demands of this project, the images used in the simulation are also in the repository, 
as well as auxiliary files used to run simulations in parallel and collect data. Finally, there is a file 
that consists of a rudimentary version of a genetic algorithm that uses the simulation to obtain the optimal
traffic light times at the studied intersection. Note that the files contained in this repository are from an 
intermediate version of the project, which is not very well organized. I will soon organize a more updated 
version so that the project can be understood more clearly.
